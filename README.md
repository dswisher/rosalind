## Purpose

This repo contains my attempts to solve problems on the [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/) web site.

## Notes

For some of the Python code in the textbook section, you will need to
have the `lib` directory in your `PYTHONPATH`:

    export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/git/rosalind/BioinformaticsTextbookTrack/lib
